# References

Resources I used.

- https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api
  - The official documentation is good. But, there are no screenshots, so I did
    not know how to go about choosing among the APIs.
- https://github.com/wix/import-cost/tree/master/packages/vscode-import-cost/src
  - I wanted to replicate some of gitlens' UIs, but their codebase is far too
    complicated for me to read.
- https://vscode.rocks/decorations/
  - I found this post late into development. It is very informative and I wish
    there was more documentation like this. Unfortunately, this guy's blog is dead.
